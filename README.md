# reducePDFQuality

When I create PDFs from my iPhone ("Scan document"), their file size seems 
excessive. This extracts JPGs out of the PDF, reduces their quality (quality, not resolution), and turns 
them back into a PDF. The reduction in quality is nearly imperceptible, but the 
reduction in file size can be ten-fold.

Requires poppler-tools, pdfunite, and ImageMagick
